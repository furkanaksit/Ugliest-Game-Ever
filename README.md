* This a course project for Computer Graphics Course. 
* It is developed using low level programming. 
* It aims to teach me how graphics card interprets nowadays computer graphics.
* Basic game controls with Space Bar to start the game or you can use the button, W A S D for moving in the space.
* Little meteorites come at you and the goal is to escape them until they stop.
* Project will no longer be developed because it is not usable and so ugly.
* Game physics are bad, graphisc are bad and programming the wasn't fun at all.
